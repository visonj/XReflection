## 🚀 Installation

### Requirements
Make sure you have the following system dependencies installed:
- Python >= 3.10
- PyTorch >= 2.5
- PyTorchLightning >= 2.5
- CUDA >= 12.1 (for GPU support)

### Installation Commands
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/XReflection.git
cd XReflection

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py develop
```

---

## 📦 Getting Started

### Inference with Pretrained Models
Run reflection removal on an image:
```python
TODO
```

### Training a Model
```bash
python tools/train.py --config configs/train_config.yaml
```

### Data Preparation
#### Training dataset
* 7,643 images from the
  [Pascal VOC dataset](http://host.robots.ox.ac.uk/pascal/VOC/), center-cropped as 224 x 224 slices to synthesize training pairs;
* 90 real-world training pairs provided by [Zhang *et al.*](https://github.com/ceciliavision/perceptual-reflection-removal);
* 200 real-world training pairs provided by [IBCLN](https://github.com/JHL-HUST/IBCLN) (In our training setting 2, &dagger; labeled in our paper).

#### Testing dataset
* 45 real-world testing images from [CEILNet dataset](https://github.com/fqnchina/CEILNet);
* 20 real testing pairs provided by [Zhang *et al.*](https://github.com/ceciliavision/perceptual-reflection-removal);
* 20 real testing pairs provided by [IBCLN](https://github.com/JHL-HUST/IBCLN);
* 454 real testing pairs from [SIR^2 dataset](https://sir2data.github.io/), containing three subsets (i.e., Objects (200), Postcard (199), Wild (55)).
